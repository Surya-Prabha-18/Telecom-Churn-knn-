# Telecom Churn Prediction using KNN

This project predicts customer churn in a telecom company using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.  
It uses features like tenure, monthly charges, and service usage to classify whether a customer will churn.  
The model is built and evaluated in Python using scikit-learn and Jupyter Notebook.
